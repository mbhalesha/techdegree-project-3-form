# Techdegree-Project-3-Form
My Third Techdegree Project

Registration Form

In this project, I have built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form for receiving news on orbital and suborbital flights. The form contains HTML, form input types, attributes, and flexbox responsive design. Using the supplied mockup files, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries and a "mobile-first" approach.
