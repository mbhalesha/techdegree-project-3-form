My Techdegree Project 3: Registration Form

https://mbhalesha.github.io/techdegree-project-3-form/

In this project, I built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form for receiving news on orbital and suborbital flights. The form contains HTML, form input types, attributes, and flexbox responsive design. Using the supplied mockup files, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries and a "mobile-first" approach.

- I learned how to create HTML form elements including input types of text, email, tel, radio buttons, and checkbox items. 
- I learned how to change the styling of focused elements, which can enhance the user experience.
- I learned Flexbox properties such as flex-direction, flex-grow, and flex-basis. Flexbox responsive design allows users to easily fill out the form on whichever screen size they are using.
